With this hands-on guide, you’ll learn how to build applications that target iOS, Android, and other mobile platforms instead of browsers. You’ll also discover how to access platform features such as the camera, user location, and local storage. With code examples and step-by-step instructions, author Bonnie Eisenman shows web developers and frontend engineers how to build and style interfaces, use mobile components, and debug and deploy apps. Along the way, you’ll build several increasingly sophisticated sample apps with React Native before putting everything together at the end. Learn how React Native provides an interface to native UI components Examine how the framework uses native components analogous to HTML elements Create and style your own React Native components and applications Install modules for APIs and features not supported by the framework Get tools for debugging your code, and for handling issues outside of JavaScript Put it all together with the Zebreto effective-memorization flashcard app Deploy apps to the iOS App Store and Google’s Play Store",

Together, they can be used to build full stack apps with enhanced security and scalability at each layer. This book will start by taking you through React and TypeScript components to build an intuitive single-page application. You'll understand how to design scalable REST APIs that can integrate with a React-based frontend. You'll get to grips with the latest features, popular patterns, and tools available in the React ecosystem, including function-based components, React Router, and Redux. The book shows how you can use TypeScript along with React to make the frontend robust and maintainable. You'll then cover important .NET Core features such as API controllers, attribute routing, and model binding to help you build a sturdy backend. Additionally, you'll explore API security with ASP.NET Core identity and authorization policies, and write reliable unit tests using both .NET Core and React before you deploy your app to the Azure cloud. By the end of the book, you'll have gained all the knowledge you need to enhance your C# and JavaScript skills and build full stack, production-ready applications with ASP.NET Core and React. What you will learn Build RESTful APIs with .NET Core using API controllers Create strongly typed, interactive, and function-based React components using Hooks Build forms efficiently using reusable React components Perform client-side state management with Redux and the React Context API Secure REST APIs with ASP.NET identity and authorization policies Run a range of automated tests on the frontend and backend Implement continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) processes into Azure using Azure DevOps Who this book is for If you're a web developer looking to build solid full-stack web applications with .NET Core and React, this book is for you. Although this book does not assume any knowledge of React, you're expected to have a basic understanding of .NET Core.",

This book also covers many other complementary tools: React Router, GraphQL, React-Bootstrap, Babel, and Webpack. This new edition will use the latest version of React (React 16) and the latest React Router (React Router 4), which has a significantly different approach to routing compared to React Router 2 which was used in the first edition of the book. Though the primary focus of Pro MERN Stack is to equip you with all that is required to build a full-fledged web application, a large portion of the book will be devoted to React 16. The popular MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node) stack introduced Single Page Apps (SPAs) and front-end Model-View-Controller (MVC) as new and efficient paradigms. Facebook's React is a technology that competes indirectly with AngularJS. It is not a full-fledged MVC framework. It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (in some sense the View part). Yet, it is possible to build a web app by replacing AngularJS with React – hence the term MERN stack What You Will Learn Discover the features of React 16 to get the maximum out of this library Gain the basics of MongoDB, Express, and Node to build a web app Work with other libraries complementary to React, including React-Bootstrap, React Router, and GraphQL Use tools such as Babel and Webpack required to build JavaScript-based SPAs Tie all the components together to build a complete web app. Who This Book Is For Developers and architects who have prior experience in any web app stack other than the MERN stack will find the book useful to learn about this modern stack. Prior knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is required.",

Explore the techniques involved in creating a full-stack app by going through a methodical approach. Learn to add CRUD functionalities and use Material UI in the user interface to make it more user-friendly. Book Description Apart from knowing how to write frontend and backend code, a full-stack engineer has to tackle all the problems that are encountered in the application development life cycle, starting from a simple idea to UI design, the technical design, and all the way to implementing, testing, production, deployment, and monitoring. This book covers the full set of technologies that you need to know to become a full-stack web developer with Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to build a modern full-stack application in practice. This book will teach you how to build RESTful API endpoints and work with the data access Layer of Spring, using Hibernate as the ORM. As we move ahead, you will be introduced to the other components of Spring, such as Spring Security, which will teach you how to secure the backend. Then, we will move on to the frontend, where you will be introduced to React, a modern JavaScript library for building fast and reliable user interfaces, and its app development environment and components. You will also create a Docker container for your application. Finally, the book will lay out the best practices that underpin professional full-stack web development. What you will learn Create a RESTful web service with Spring Boot Understand how to use React for frontend programming Gain knowledge of how to create unit tests using JUnit Discover the techniques that go into securing the backend using Spring Security Learn how to use Material UI in the user interface to make it more user-friendly Create a React app by using the Create React App starter kit made by Facebook Who this book is for Java developers who are familiar with Spring, but have not yet built full-stack applications",
